# Django Code of Conduct

## Structure of membership in the committee

Members of the committee are all volunteers, and we're always aiming to have
high representation of people coming from different places and backgrounds.
There is no set number of people required to be on the committee at the moment.
Committee tries to keep the number as small as possible due to sensitivity of
the matter, but big enough to achieve diversity of the views and fast response
time to incoming reports.

Whenever there is a need to add new members, committee reviews proposals from
people who volunteered thus far but are not on the committee yet. If that
number is still too low, a call for volunteers is published on Django blog.

### Terms of membership:

Starting on 25th May, 2016, committee decided to introduce fixed-term
membership. Each member of the committee is only obligated to serve on the
committee for a fixed period of time, with 6-9 months being a default term. The
idea behind it allows members of the committee to step down from serving
without feeling guilty, and assumes an opt-in membership instead of opt-out, as
it was thus far.

| Member             | Join date        | Length of term | Next opt-in date |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Jeff Triplett      | May 5th 2016     | 9 months       | April 30th 2019  |
| Brian Moloney      | February 1, 2017 | 9 months       | April 30th 2019  |
| Olumide Bakare     | February 1, 2017 | 9 months       | April 30th 2019  |
| Joseph V. Cardenas | February 1, 2017 | 9 months       | April 30th 2019  |
| Michael Clark      | February 1, 2017 | 9 months       | April 30th 2019  |
| Tibbs Hefflin      | February 1, 2017 | 9 months       | April 30th 2019  |

After the membership term ends, the invitation to stay in the committee is
automatically extended, but member has to confirm they're indeed still
interested and have time to serve on the committee (opt-in).
